# Composio Example Agent 

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Make sure you enable Composio in your desktop app by setting a Composio key, or run the Letta server with `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` set when you start the server ([documentation](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/composio)). You will also need to enable the Github star tool on Composio. 

This is an agent which uses a Composio tool to star an a provided repository. If you have Composio enabled on Letta, you can load the `composio_github_star_agent.af` into the ADE and chat with an agent that has the ability to star github repos.
