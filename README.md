**Agent File (`.af`)** is an open standard file format for serializing [stateful agents](https://www.letta.com/blog/stateful-agents). Originally designed for the [Letta](https://letta.com) framework, Agent File provides a portable way to share agents with persistent memory and behavior.

Agent Files package all components of a stateful agent: system prompts, editable memory (personality and user information), tool configurations (code and schemas), and LLM settings. By standardizing these elements in a single format, Agent File enables seamless transfer between compatible frameworks, while allowing for easy checkpointing and version control of agent state.

## üëæ Download Example Agents

Browse our collection of ready-to-use agents below. Each agent has a direct download link (to download the `.af` file) and a separate instructions README with a guide on how to use the agent. To contribute your own Agent File to the repo, simply [open a pull request](https://github.com/letta-ai/agent-file/compare)!

To use one of the agents, download the agent file (`.af`) by clicking the link below, then upload it to [Letta](https://docs.letta.com) or any other framework that supports Agent File.

## Using `.af` with Letta 

### Importing Agents 
You can load downloaded `.af` files into your ADE (running with Docker, Desktop, or Letta Cloud) to re-create the agent: 
![Importing Demo](./assets/import_demo.gif)

### Exporting Agents 
You can export your own `.af` files to share (or contribute!) by selecting "Export Agent" in the ADE: 
![Exporting Demo](./assets/export_demo.gif)

## FAQ

### Why Agent File?

The AI ecosystem is witnessing rapid growth in agent development, with each framework implementing its own storage mechanisms. Agent File addresses the need for a standard that enables:

- **Portability**: Move agents between systems or deploy them to new environments
- **Collaboration**: Share your agents with other developers and the community
- **Preservation**: Archive agent configurations to preserve your work
- **Versioning**: Track changes to agents over time through a standardized format

### What state does `.af` include?

A `.af` file contains all the state required to re-create the exact same agent:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Model configuration | Context window limit, model name, embedding model name |
| Message history | Complete chat history with `in_context` field indicating if a message is in the current context window |
| System prompt | Initial instructions that define the agent's behavior |
| Memory blocks | In-context memory segments for personality, user info, etc. |
| Tool rules | Definitions of how tools should be sequenced or constrained |
| Environment variables | Configuration values for tool execution |
| Tools | Complete tool definitions including source code and JSON schema |

We currently do not support Passages (the units of Archival Memory in Letta/MemGPT), which have support for them on the roadmap.

You can view the entire schema of .af in the Letta repository [here](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta/blob/main/letta/serialize_schemas/pydantic_agent_schema.py).

### Does `.af` work with frameworks other than Letta?

Theoretically, other frameworks could also load in `.af` files if they convert the state into their own representations. Some concepts, such as context window "blocks" which can be edited or shared between agents, are not implemented in other frameworks, so may need to be adapted per-framework.

### How can I add Agent File support to my framework?

Adding `.af` support requires mapping Agent File components (agent state) to your framework's equivalent featureset. The main steps include parsing the schema, translating prompts/tools/memory, and implementing import/export functionality.

For implementation details or to contribute to Agent File, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/letta) or check the [Letta GitHub repository](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta).

### How does .af handle secrets?

Agents have associated secrets for tool execution in Letta (see [docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/tool-variables)). When you export agents with secrets, the secrets are set to `null`.

## Roadmap 
- [ ] Support MCP servers/configs
- [ ] Support archival memory passages
- [ ] Support data sources (i.e. files)
- [ ] Migration support between schema changes
- [ ] Multi-agent `.af` files
- [ ] Converters between frameworks
